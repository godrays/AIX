# AIX (C++)

AIX is a single-header C++ machine learning framework inspired by PyTorch, designed by Arkin Terli for research and AI/ML model development.

### Overview

AIX is designed for high readability while leveraging device acceleration for efficient computations. It supports a wide range of ML and DL tasks, focusing on performance and scalability for both research and production environments.

Key features include:
- Single-header framework with no external dependencies
- Auto differentiation
- Dynamic computation graphs
- Multi-dimension tensor support
- Auto tensor shape alignment (broadcasting)
- Auto data type conversion and promotion
- Plug-and-play hardware acceleration
- Extensible API for custom operations and layers

### Examples

Examples demonstrating AIX usage can be found in the `Targets/AIXExamples` folder.

| Example          | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| XORApp           | Create a custom Module.                         |
| XORLayerApp      | Use a module within another module.             |
| XORMetalApp      | Use Metal acceleration on Apple Silicon.        |       
| XORSequentialApp | Use the Sequential module.                      |

### Quick Start

Below is an example to train a model for the XOR problem with Metal acceleration for Apple Silicon.

```C++
#include <aix.hpp>
#include <aixDevices.hpp>   // Optional: For acceleration/device support only.

int main()
{
    constexpr int   kNumSamples    = 4;
    constexpr int   kNumInputs     = 2;
    constexpr int   kNumTargets    = 1;
    constexpr int   kNumEpochs     = 1000;
    constexpr float kLearningRate  = 0.02f;
    constexpr float kLossThreshold = 1e-5f;

    // Create a device that uses Apple Metal for GPU computations.
    auto device = aix::createDevice(aix::DeviceType::kGPU_METAL);

    // Create a model.
    aix::nn::Sequential  model;
    model.add(new aix::nn::Linear(kNumInputs, 8));
    model.add(new aix::nn::Tanh());
    model.add(new aix::nn::Linear(8, 4));
    model.add(new aix::nn::Tanh());
    model.add(new aix::nn::Linear(4, kNumTargets));

    model.to(*device);      // Move the model to the device.

    // Example inputs and targets for demonstration purposes.
    auto inputs  = aix::tensor({0.0, 0.0,
                                0.0, 1.0,
                                1.0, 0.0,
                                1.0, 1.0}, {kNumSamples, kNumInputs}).to(*device);

    auto targets = aix::tensor({0.0,
                                1.0,
                                1.0,
                                0.0}, {kNumSamples, kNumTargets}).to(*device);

    // Create an optimizer.
    aix::optim::Adam optimizer(model.parameters(), kLearningRate);

    // Create a loss function.
    auto lossFunc = aix::nn::MSELoss();

    // Training loop.
    for (size_t epoch = 0; epoch < kNumEpochs; ++epoch)
    {
        auto predictions = model.forward(inputs);
        auto loss = lossFunc(predictions, targets);

        optimizer.zeroGrad();       // Zero the gradients before backward pass.
        loss.backward();            // Compute all gradients in the graph.
        optimizer.step();           // Update neural net's learnable parameters.

        device->commitAndWait();    // Finalize compute batch.

        // Stop training process when loss is lower than the threshold.
        if (loss.value().item() <= kLossThreshold)
            break;
    }

    // Use the trained model for prediction.
    auto predictions = model.forward(inputs);
    device->commitAndWait();

    std::cout << predictions << std::endl;
    // ...
}
```

# Guidance

AIX balances readability and optimization by using a reference device in aix.hpp and supporting plug-and-play devices for 
high-performance acceleration. By default, AIX uses the reference device.

The following core classes form the foundation of AIX:

- `Tensor:` A multi-dimensional array that supports dynamic computation graphs for all operations.
- `TensorValue:` A non-graph version of Tensor, used for computations on the device.
- `Device:` Reference device that allows hardware acceleration for computations.

All other functionalities in AIX are built upon these three primary classes.

### How to build a custom device for hardware acceleration

Derive a new device from the reference device in `aix.hpp` and implement it for immediate use.

```C++
#include <aix.hpp>

class MyDevice : public aix::Device
{
    // Implement your new acceleration device here.
};

int main()
{
    MyDevice device;

    aix::nn::Sequential  model;
    // Add your model layers here

    model.to(device);      // Move the model to the device.
    // ...
}
```

Each custom device should be tested against the reference device implemented in `aix.hpp`. This allows developers to create highly optimized devices without modifying the framework. 
In the future, we plan to publish a device leaderboard to showcase performance.

# Project Build Instructions

Follow the following steps to build the project and make it deployment ready.

Currently, it has been built and tested on macOS Sonoma with no issues.

---

### Step 1: Build Externals

This step will build external libraries.

```bash
cd Externals
./build_all.sh
```

### Step 2: Build Targets

This step will build all binaries and deploy into a specific folder. Assuming you are in the root folder of the project.

```bash
./build.sh release product-rel
```

After the successful build, all target binaries will be deployed into the product-rel folder.

Note: Run the build.sh file without parameters to see all options.

### Build Options

Use the following CMake build options to turn ON or OFF in production:

- AIX_BUILD_STATIC
- AIX_BUILD_EXAMPLES
- AIX_BUILD_TESTS

All options are OFF by default. build.sh enables tests and examples for development purposes only.
